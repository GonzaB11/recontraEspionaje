# Secure Messaging Network

## About the Project
This project solves the problem of securely sending a message to a network of spies while minimizing the probability of interception. Using a graph and Prim's algorithm, it generates a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) that connects the spies, allowing users to query their information and relationships.

## Features
- **Secure Communication Network**: Uses graph structures to minimize interception risk.
- **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**: Implements Prim's algorithm to optimize spy connections.
- **Interactive Map Visualization**: Displays spies and their connections using graphical representation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Java Swing using Windows Builder (JFrame).
- **Separated Presentation Design**: Ensures a structured architecture by separating business logic from the UI.
- **Automated Testing**: Uses JUnit for testing to ensure system reliability.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: Core programming language for logic implementation.
- **Windows Builder (JFrame)**: UI design for an intuitive user experience.
- **JMap**: Used for map rendering and drawing connections between spies.
- **JUnit**: Framework for writing and running automated tests.

## Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/GonzaB11/recontraEspionaje.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Eclipse or your preferred Java IDE.
3. Ensure you have **Windows Builder** and **JMap** installed for UI and visualization.
4. Run the application from the main class.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing encryption for secure message transmission.
- Adding real-time updates to spy connections.
- Enhancing the UI with more detailed map interactions.
